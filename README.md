# Smart Signature Verification System (EDV 2026)

This project is an AI-based signature verification system built using deep learning and computer vision.  
It verifies handwritten signatures and classifies them as **Accept**, **Review**, or **Reject** using a confidence-based decision logic.

---

## Features
- Live signature verification using canvas input
- Signature verification via image upload (PNG/JPG)
- CNN-based deep learning model (ResNet50)
- Threshold-based decision system (Accept / Review / Reject)
- Clean and explainable UI for demonstrations

---

## Tech Stack
- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- AI Model: TensorFlow / Keras (CNN – ResNet50)
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy
